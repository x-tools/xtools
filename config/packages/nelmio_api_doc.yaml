            description:
                XTools features a rich API for much of the data available through the web interface.
                Out of courtesy we ask you make requests synchronously – as in one full round trip – before making a
                new request. Please leave an informative user agent in your request so we can contact you if we need to.


                This documentation is supplemented by [on-wiki documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/XTools/API)
                that may contain more information on the endpoints described here. This API is not versioned.
                Log any occurrences of the `warning` property in responses, which will announce deprecations and
                future changes. Fatal errors are in the format specified by
                [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807).


                A note to researchers – You may first want to review the
                [Action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/API:Main_page)
                and [REST API](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/) to see if they meet your needs. They
                will be considerably faster than XTools. If you need to do analysis on millions of pages, it may be
                more suitable to write your own program that works off a [dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/).
